## Here are some packages I think are useful for doing network meta-analysis

[gemtc](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gemtc/index.html): A package for doing network meta-analysis under Bayesian framework.

[pcnetmeta](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pcnetmeta/index.html): Another package for doing network meta-analysis under Bayesian framework. It's less functional but faster than `gemtc`.

[netmeta](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/netmeta/index.html): A package for doing network meta-analysis under frequentist framework.

[igraph](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/igraph/index.html): Useful package for network visualization.
